    "# Lab 1 - Python \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Wikipedia, [Python] is a widely used interpreted, high-level programming language used for general-purpose programming. It has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first look at the characteristics of the language:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **General purpose**: not built for a particular usage, it works as well for scientific computing as for web and application development. It features high-level data structures and supports multiple paradigms: procedural, object-oriented and functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Elegant syntax**: easy-to-read and intuitive code, easy-to-learn minimalistic syntax, quick to write (low boilerplate / verbosity), maintainability scales well with size of projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Expressive language**: fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some technical details:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Dynamically typed**: no need to define the type of variables, function arguments or return types.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Automatic memory management** (garbage collector): no need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays. No memory leak bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Interpreted**: No need to compile the code. The Python interpreter reads and executes the python code directly. It also means that a single Python source runs anywhere a runtime is available, like on Windows, Mac, Linux and in the Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Ease of programming**: it is very intuitive to write Python code, minimizing the time required to develop, debug and maintain the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Well-designed language**: it encourages many good programming practices, such as modularity, object-oriented programmed, good system for packaging, large open-source community, integrated documentation, among many ofthers.\n",
    "\n",
    "And some disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Two versions**: there are two versions of Python in general use: 2 and 3. While Python 3 is now well adopted, some libraries or legacy code still only support Python 2 leading sometimes to incompatibility. In this class, we will use Python 3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Slow execution**: due to its interpreted and dynamic nature, the execution of Python code can be slow compared to compiled statically typed programming languages, such as C and Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **No compiler**: there is no compiler to catch your errors. Solutions include unit / integration tests or the use of a [linter] such as [pyflakes], [Pylint] or [PyChecker]. [Flake8] combines static analysis with style checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [Python]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\n",
    "  [linter]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29\n",
    "  [pyflakes]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes\n",
    "  [Pylint]: https://www.pylint.org\n",
    "  [PyChecker]: http://pychecker.sourceforge.net\n",
    "  [Flake8]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8\n",
    "  \n",
    "Finally, a general tip: Python is really easy to read, and libraries always provide in-code as well as on-line documentation that you should read. \"[*Read the doc*](https://docs.python.org/3.5/)\" should be your moto when coding in Python.\n",
