    "# Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/index.html) is an HTML-based notebook which allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. It allows a clean presentation of computational results as HTML or PDF reports and is well suited for interactive tasks such as data cleaning, transformation and exploration, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and more. It runs everywhere (Window, Mac, Linux, Cloud) and supports multiple languages through various kernels, e.g. Python, R, Julia, Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "When inside a notebook, there are two modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edit mode**: as its name tells, you are editing a cell (writing something). The selected cell has a <span style=\"color: green;\">green</span> border.\n",
    "2. **Command mode**: this mode allows you to interact with the notebook structure. The selected cell has a <span style=\"color: blue;\">blue</span> border.\n",
    "\n",
    "When in command mode, press `<Enter>` or click to *enter* edit mode. When in edit mode, press `<Esc>` to *leave* edit mode and enter command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keyboard shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "Something that you should know is that you can perform a lot of actions using specific keyboard shortcuts. That way you never have to remove your hands from the keys to reach the mouse. You can keep your brain connected directly to the screen, allowing your ideas to flow smoothly to the editor :) Productivity improvement guaranteed!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is composed of **cells**. Each cell has a *type*, the most relevant being the *Code* and the *[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)* types. You can interact with the cells in different ways. We will go through the basic actions that you can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insert a cell\n",
    "The first thing is of course to **create** a cell. You always create cells *relatively to the selected one* (the one that has a colored border). There are several ways to do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using the menu.** Click on `Insert -> Insert Cell Above/Bellow`.\n",
    "2. **Using a shortcut.** When in command mode, press `<A>` (**a**bove) or `<B>` (**b**ellow).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You can of course **delete** a cell. Again, there are two ways to do so. After selecting a cell to delete, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the menu, select `Edit -> Delete Cells`.\n",
    "2. When in command mode, press `<DD>` (**d**elete, twice because it is a risky operation...).\n",

    "We have not done anything meaningful so far. To really make use of the notebook, we need to be able to **execute** the cells. Executing a Markdown cell will only *render* its content. Executing a Code cell will actually evaluate it. Potential outputs (print, plot, ...) will be displayed right bellow the cell. Again, there are several ways to do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the menu, select one of `Cell -> Run [something]`.\n",
    "2. Using the toolbar, click on the \"play\" button (the triangle with a bar on its right, next to the big square).\n",
    "3. Using the keyboard, you have several options:\n",
    "    - `<Ctrl>-<Enter>` will execute the cell and keep it selected.\n",
    "    - `<Shift>-<Enter>` will execute the cell and select the one bellow.\n",
