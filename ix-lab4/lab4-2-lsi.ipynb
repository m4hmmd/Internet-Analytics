To avoid long cells of codes in the notebook, you can also embed long python functions and classes in a separate module. Don’t forget to hand in your module if that is the case. In multiple exercises, you are required to come up with your own method to solve various problems. Be creative and clearly motivate and explain your methods. Creativity and clarity will be considered for grading.*"

    "Firstly, the TF-IDF matrix represents the relationship between terms and documents. Specifically, each of the $14513$ rows is a term represented as its importance/relevance to each of the $854$ courses, and each of the $854$ columns is a course represented as the importances/relevances of the $14513$ terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an SVD is taken with $rank=300$, the matrices $U$ will be $14513\\times 300$ and $V^T$ will be $300\\times 854$. Now, there is an intermediate matrix $\\Sigma$ with dimensions $300\\times 300$ which represents the importance of the latent factors / concepts / categories. $\\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of the original matrix. The $i$th singular value represents the importance of the $i$th latent factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, now in $U$, each of the $14513$ rows is a term represented as its \"strength of membership\" to each of the $300$ latent factors, and each of the $300$ columns is a latent factor represented as the \"strengths of membership\" of each of the $14513$ terms. In $V^T$, each of the $300$ rows is a latent factor represented as its relevance to each of the $854$ courses, and each of the $854$ columns is a course represented as the relevances of each of the $300$ latent factors."

The methods are applied in the field and in the laboratory and a report prepared using the measured data. Content Objectives The cryosphere forms an integral part of the climate system of the Earth. Measuring the properties of the seasonal and perennial snow cover properties is therefore essential in understanding interactions and feedback mechanisms related to the cryosphere. Snow is an extremely complex and highly variable medium, and all essential properties of seasonal snow cover are challenging to measure. Diverse fields such as hydrology, climatology, avalanche forecasting and Earth Observation from space benefit from improved quantification of snow cover properties, in particular related to the snow microstructure. The past 10 years snow science has seen a rapid change from a semi-quantitative to a quantitative science. Understanding physical and chemical processes in the snowpack requires detailed measurements of the microstructure. The Snow Science Winter School will teach these advanced techniques, as micro-tomography, measurement of specific surface area by reflection and spectroscopy, near-infrared photography and high-resolution penetrometry. The laboratory measurements (micro-CT, thin section, fabric analysis) will take place in Davos. Every other year the course takes places in Northern Finland (Sodankylä), with the focus on field methods and the arctic snowpack. \\xa0 Target audience Any graduate student or post-doc working on snow or in some snow related field is welcome to participate. Those fields include Glaciology, Hydrology, Oceanography, Geography, but also Biology or Chemistry as well as Engineering or Material Sciences. \\xa0 Course structure The focus of this workshop lies on field and laboratory measurements, combined with theoretical lessons in the classroom. Obligatory reading is provided about one month before the workshop, and will be examined during the school. Field and laboratory measurements will be done in small groups of 3-4 students. Each group of students will have to prepare a report describing the methods, results and interpretation of the measured data after the course. in 2017 the following lecturers are participating: 'Martin Schneebeli, WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF, Davos, Switzerland 'Juha Lemmetyinen, Finnish Meteorological Institute FMI, Helsinki, Finland and others, see http://www.slf.ch/dienstleistungen/events/snowschool/index_EN \\xa0 Admission For admission, the students have to apply in advance and are selected by the organizing committee.
